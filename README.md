# PISA 2012 analysis

## Introduction
In this project i have done some analyses on PISA 2012 study. This study examines how well students have learned the school curriculum, how well prepared they are for life beyond school. Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.
As the dataset is quite large, i had to focus on a small part of the dataset which i was interested in mostly.
