# Teachers' and parents' impact on well-being and success of students in PISA study 2012
## by Philipp Nockemann


## Dataset

In this slideshow i am going to explore the PISA 2012 dataset. This dataset is the result of PISA study. This study examines how well students have learned the school curriculum, how well prepared they are for life beyond school. Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

## Summary of Findings

- In my exploration i began showing some distributions which are always present in media publications on PISA study.

- Bivariate barplots showed impacts of socio-economic backgrounds of parents on students scores. Surprisingly children of people with highest schooling scored worse than others.
- A 2D-Histogram showed that almost no students that feel like they don't belong to school could score high in PISA study. This emphasizes the importance of making school a space of identification for everything.
- Numerous Boxenplots make us understand that teachers can influence student's senses of belonging to school by student-oriented behaviour. Most important are encouraging students to reflect problems and giving them the opportunity to express their opinion.

- Multivariat heatmaps showed: Especially the combination of a positive disciplinary climate and student orientation seems to lead to good results rather than low scores in these features. We have to qualify that medium scores in these features lead to good results as well.
- A faceted scatterplot of parent's job status, out-of-school study time and PISA scores couldn't reveal any clear pattern between those three features.
- Pointplots relating four features showed: For scores of students who don't feel like they belong to school, fairness matters on every level of teacher's listening ability. In contrast, on the higher levels of Sense of belonging, fairness only matters to those who don't feel heard. Being listened to has a bigger impact here.


## Key Insights for Presentation

I chose four visualizations for this slide show, which show relations as follows: Visualization 1 - Parental background and success, Visualization 2 - Sense of belonging and success, Visualization 3 - Follow up: Teacher's behaviour and sense of belonging and Visualization 4:  Student-teacher-relationship and success by sense of belonging ranges.
I added a lot of titles and polished up some ticks, labels and color choices.
